# Vixen.Engine

The layer a game is written against. `Vixen.Ecs` is the storage and the schedule; this is the
vocabulary — transforms, scenes, prefabs, the frame loop, and the `Behavior` API.

Spec: [docs/plan/04-ecs-and-scripting.md](../../docs/plan/04-ecs-and-scripting.md) § Layer 3.

## Transforms and hierarchy

```csharp
var parent = Hierarchy.CreateTransform(world, LocalTransform.At(new(10, 0, 0)));
var child  = Hierarchy.CreateTransform(world, LocalTransform.At(new(0, 5, 0)));
Hierarchy.SetParent(world, child, parent);
```

Five components describe the relationship: `Parent`, `Child` (the head of a list), `Sibling` (the
intrusive doubly-linked list itself), `HierarchyDepth`, and the `LocalTransform` / `WorldTransform`
pair. `Hierarchy` is the only supported way to change the shape — every one of those components can
be written directly, and everything that does will eventually produce a list that loops back on
itself or a depth that disagrees with the parent chain.

Adding or removing a child is O(1) with no allocation, which is what makes reparenting cheap enough
to do in gameplay code rather than only at load.

**`TransformSystem` touches nothing that did not move.** It starts from the chunks whose
`LocalTransform` column has been written since it last ran, and walks down from there; a frame in
which nothing moved visits nothing. Reparenting and creation are caught for free, because both move
the entity to a different archetype and an archetype move stamps every column of the destination
row — neither needs a dirty flag.

**One deviation from doc 04, named rather than approximated.** That design splits archetypes by
`HierarchyDepth` so every level is a sequential sweep over chunks. A component's *value* takes no
part in its archetype here, and making it do so means shared components, which the ECS does not
have. So depth 0 — the roots, which *are* an archetype question (`WithNone<Parent>`) — is a
sequential sweep over spans, and the levels below are walked through the child lists into reused
per-depth buckets. The cost is random access below the roots; the work is still one visit per moved
entity, and a steady state allocates nothing (`ASteadyStateSceneAllocatesNothing` pins that). Adding
shared components later would make the lower levels sweeps too without changing anything a caller
sees.
