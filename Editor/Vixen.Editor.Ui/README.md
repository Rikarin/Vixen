# Vixen.Editor.Ui

The editor shell from [docs/plan/11](../../docs/plan/11-editor.md) § "`Vixen.Editor.Ui` — the
shell": docking over the existing `DockingHost`, a command registry, menus/toolbars/palette as views
over it, theming, notifications, background tasks, and localisation.

```csharp
using var shell = new EditorShell(1600f, 1000f);

shell.RegisterPanel("scene", new StringId("editor.panel.scene", "Scene"), panel => panel.Add<Viewport>());
shell.RegisterLayout("Default", new StringId("editor.layout.default", "Default"),
    () => LayoutPresets.Standard(["hierarchy"], ["scene"], ["inspector"], ["console"]));

shell.Commands.Add(new EditorCommand("file.save", EditorStrings.CommandSave, project.Save) {
    Enablement = () => project.IsDirty
});
shell.Keys.SetDefault("file.save", new KeyChord(InputKey.S, ModifierKeys.Control));

shell.Workspace.Reset();
```

`file.save` is now in the File menu, in the command palette, on Ctrl+S, and greyed out when the
project is clean. Nothing was told about it twice.

## Everything is a command

Doc 11's claim is that "menus, toolbars, context menus and the command palette are all *views over
the command registry*, so a new action appears everywhere at once". `MenuPresenter`,
`ToolbarPresenter` and `CommandPaletteSource` are those views, and each holds command *ids* rather
than labels — so a command renamed, rebound, disabled or translated is right in all four places
without any of them being told.

**Enablement is a predicate, not a flag.** A flag has to be pushed at every view whenever the world
changes, which means a menu that is right only if somebody remembered to invalidate it. A menu asks
as it opens; a toolbar asks on the tick. The cost is that the predicate must be cheap —
`stack.CanUndo`, not a directory scan.

**A command carries no keybinding.** That is `KeyMap`'s, because a binding is the user's and a
command is the application's.

## Keybindings

Two layers: the defaults the application ships and the overrides the user made, and only the second
is saved. A keymap file holding every binding freezes the defaults at the version the user first ran
— every editor that shipped one has a support burden to prove it.

Conflicts are **detected, not resolved**: a chord belongs to one command, and binding an occupied
chord fails and says who has it. Bindings **survive the commands they name**, so unloading a plugin
does not throw away the shortcut the user gave it.

⚠ **A chord with no Control or Meta is not taken from a text field.** A single-key binding — `F` for
frame-selection, which every 3D editor has — would otherwise fire while somebody was naming an
object, and the object would end up called `Cubeaaa` with the camera somewhere else.

## Docking

`DockingHost` (in `Vixen.Ui.Controls.Advanced`) knows about panels by id, splits, tabs, dragging and
a serialisable arrangement. It knows nothing about where a panel's contents come from or what "the
Shading layout" is, which is right for a control in `Vixen.Ui`. `DockingWorkspace` is the other half:
a registry of what can be shown, lazy construction, named presets and one place that saves.

⚠ **A preset is a factory, not a layout.** One handed out as an object is the object the first
splitter drag edits — and "reset to Default" then puts the window back to whatever the user last
dragged it to.

⚠ **Restoring an arrangement writes the saved tab selection back after the panels are built.**
Opening a panel brings it to the front, which is what it means everywhere else, so a two-tab group
would otherwise always come back showing whichever panel happened to be built last.

## The palette

`Ctrl/Cmd+P`, fuzzy, over an ordered list of `IPaletteSource`. Commands are one source; assets,
scene objects and settings are others and are not this assembly's business.

The matching is subsequence-with-bonuses — a run beats scattered letters, a word start beats the
middle, a shorter candidate beats a longer one that matched equally well. A source does its **own**
matching, because an asset index with a hundred thousand entries wants something better than a
linear scan and a palette that dictated the search would prevent it.

⚠ **The field keeps the focus and the rows never take it.** A palette where Down moved the focus
into the list is one where the next letter typed goes nowhere.

## Theming

Nine custom properties on the root and one class name. `ThemeService.Mode` writes `dark`; a user
theme file is a YAML mapping of token to value compiled into an *author* stylesheet, which beats the
three user-agent sheets by origin — so overriding `--accent` needs no `!important` and no knowledge
of the control set's selectors.

The sheet order is `ControlTheme` → `AdvancedTheme` → `EditorTheme`, and it matters: each is written
against tokens the one before declares, and a custom property nothing declared substitutes to
nothing.

## Notifications and background work

A toast **and** a history, because the thing a user does after an import fails is look away, look
back, and find the message gone. ⚠ **An error does not expire**; everything else does.

Background tasks are never a modal dialog. Work runs wherever the caller put it, what it reports is
queued, and `Pump()` applies the queue at one point in the frame — so a status bar never draws a
title that was replaced between two reads. The pump has a budget, which is a livelock guard rather
than a nicety: a task reporting per file over a hundred thousand files can enqueue faster than a
frame can drain.

## Localisation

Every user-visible string is a `StringId` — an id and the English text it says — so
`item.Label = EditorStrings.Save.Text` is no more work than the literal and there is never a reason
to write the literal. That is the retrofit `Stride.Core.Translation` exists to repair.

⚠ **The source text lives at the declaration, not in an `en` catalog.** An editor whose fallback is
a file shows `editor.command.file.save` to anybody whose install is missing it. Here the worst case
is English. `Strings.Missing` is the list a translator works from.

`Strings` is the one static thing in the assembly, and the price is that anything subscribed to
`Strings.Changed` must unsubscribe — `MenuPresenter` is `IDisposable` for exactly this, and
`EditorShell.Dispose` calls it.

## What is deliberately not here

- **`Vixen.Editor.Core`.** A command is an id and a delegate; a panel is an id and a factory. Nothing
  here knows what a project, a document or an undo stack is, which is what lets the whole assembly be
  tested against a bare `UiDocument` — the same bargain `Vixen.Ui` makes with `Vixen.Platform`.
  Joining the two is `Vixen.Editor.App`'s job.
- **A window.** Floating dock groups float *within the document*; promoting one to an OS window needs
  a second surface, swapchain and input queue, which belong to `Vixen.Platform` and the app head.

## Known gaps

- **A keybinding editor.** `KeyMap` has the model — conflict detection, per-command customisation,
  reset — and no UI. Interactive "press a key" capture is `Vixen.Input`'s rebinding path.
- **A notification panel.** The history is kept and bounded; only the toasts and the task centre have
  views.
- **`Strings.Resource` generation.** `EditorStrings` is hand-written in the shape the generator will
  emit, so nothing at a call site changes when it lands — but an id used nowhere and an id declared
  nowhere are not yet build errors.
- **Layout presets do not remember floating groups' promotion**, because nothing can promote one yet.
